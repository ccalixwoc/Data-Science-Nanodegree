## Installation
To run this project, I used Python 3 and installed the following libraries: numpy, pandas and plotly.

## Motivation
As part of my Udacity Nanodegree in Data Science, I ran an exploratory analysis on COVID-19 to help myself understand more about the virus in the midst of the global pandemia. The questions that my analysis are aimed at answering are the following:
- How does the number of cases differ between the two viruses?
- What are the countries with the highest number of cases in both outbreaks?
- How do recovery rates and mortality rates compare among both diseases?

## File Descriptions
My analysis can be found in this [file](https://github.com/ccalixwoc/Data-Science-Nanodegree-Project-1/blob/master/dsnd-project-1.ipynb). This Jupyter notebook demonstrates all the related work to answer the questions above. It includes the preprocessing steps required to analyze both datasets on COVID-19 and SARS together. Additionally, it includes all the Plotly visualizations used to answer these questions. 

## Results
You can find my results in this Medium [post](https://medium.com/@ccalix.woc/a-small-comparative-analysis-between-covid-19-and-sars-de23a3574216).
